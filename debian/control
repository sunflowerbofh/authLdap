Description: Uses existing LDAP as authentication-backend for wordpress
 WordPress is a full featured web blogging tool:
    * Instant publishing (no rebuilding)
    * Comment pingback support with spam protection
    * Non-crufty URLs
    * Themable
    * Plugin support
 .
 AuthLDAP allows WordPress admins to use an existing LDAP as authentication
 base for WordPress.
 Characteristics of the plugin:
  * Flexible: Users are totaly free in which LDAP-backend to use. Due to the
    extensive configuration people can freely decide how to do the
    authentication of your users. It simply depends on your filters.
  * Independent: As soon as a user logs in, it is added/updated to the
    Wordpress' user-database to allow wordpress to always use the correct data.
    Wordpress admins only have to administer your users once.
  * Failsafe: Due to the users being created in Wordpress' User-database they
    can also log in when the LDAP-backend currently is gone.
  * Role-Aware: Wordpress' roles can be mapped to values of an existing
    LDAP-attribute.
